My implementation for connect 4 uses a multi-dim array to represent the game board. I use several functions, some of which take in an array as a parameter. To print out the board, I traverse the array and map the numbers (0, 1, 2) to (".", "X","O"). My implementation also includes three different end-game states (win, lose, or draw). An AI (that plays at a 5th grade level) is included to be the player's opponent. No global variables were used for my implementation. The player can choose to go first or second. There is also a move list displayed at the end of each game.
