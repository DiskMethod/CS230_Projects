My program is broken up into three source files and two header files.

main.c:
This file handles the environment variable, arguments, and data within stdin.

mystring.c:
Implements several string manipulation functions that aid in parsing the txt files

mystring.h:
Contains prototyping and short comments describing the what each function does

mywordhist.c:
Implements a histogram-like data structure to hold all the words from the txt files

mywordhist.h:
Contains prototyping, comments, typedefs, and structs
